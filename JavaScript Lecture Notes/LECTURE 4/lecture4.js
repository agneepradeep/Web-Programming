//Arrays in JAVASCRIPT
//let heroes = ["Iron Man","Thor","Captain America","Hulk"]
//let marks = [87,96,45,23,100]
//let com = ["Iron Man",87]

//heroes.length <-- Returns length of array
//Array Indices --> heroes[0],heroes[1]...
//Arrays Are Mutable Type Therefore Can Change Values from the middle of the index
//While Strigs will not change --> as they are immutable data type

//typeof(heroes) --> object
//object = {key1:value1, key2:value2, ....}
//Array = {index0:value0,index1:value1,....}

//Looping in Array Can be done in Many Ways
//for loop
//while loop
//for-of loop

//Arrays Methods
//.push(Item(s)): add to end --> Add Single or multiple items
//.pop(): delete from end & return
//.toString(): converts array to string
//.concat(array2): joins multiple arrays & returns result. Doesn't change the original array  
//.unshift(item1,item2...): add to start
//.shif(): delete from start & return
//.slice(i,j): returns a piece of the array -->Doesn't change the original array
//.splice(startidx,delCount,newEl1): change the original array (add,remove,replace)
